# CSC100003 - Crossy Road clone

In this project, we utilised all of our knowledge and techniques in order to create a fun, beautiful game called 'crossy roads'. 
Our game is about us, the character, who wants to cross roads and rivers to get to the grocery store. However, our journey is intervened by the neverending traffic. We, the player, have to get our character safely to the other side, and as we successfully progress, we get points.
The player can use buttons from their keyboard for controlling the character, and the game is over once the character got hit by an obstacle or the time  limit is up.
The game is mainly comprised of our c++ source codes, as well as hand-drawn sprites from art designing applications (such as Pixel Studio) and non-copyrighted sound effects from various sources online.
Thank you Mr. Truong Toan Thinh for providing us the opportunity to be involved in such an amazing project as this.
