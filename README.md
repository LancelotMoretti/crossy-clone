## Description

This is the project of our Object-Oriented Programming course, which is a clone of the popular game Crossy Road with similar gameplay and graphics.

Programmed in C++, the project adopted the Object-Oriented paradigm (which we studied throughout the course) with the use of the Windows API for graphics and audio playback. The project is a clone of the popular game Crossy Road, with similar gameplay and graphics.

The game is about us, the character, who wants to cross roads and rivers to get to the grocery store but was intervened by the neverending traffic. We, the player, have to get our character safely to the other side, and we gain points as we progress through the roads. The player can use buttons from their keyboard for controlling the character, and the game is over once the character got hit by an obstacle or the time limit is up.
